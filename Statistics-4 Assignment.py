# Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

#High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total

#Female 60 54 46 41 201

#Male 40 44 53 57 194

#Total 100 98 99 98 395

#Question:{}

#Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?

#For a test of independence, we use the same chi-squared formula that we used for the goodness-of-fit test. 
#The main difference is we have to calculate the expected counts of each cell in a 2-dimensional table instead of a 1-dimensional table.
#To get the expected count for a cell, multiply the row total for that cell by the column total for that cell and then divide by the total number of observations. 
#We can quickly get the expected counts for all cells in the table by taking the row totals and column totals of the table, performing an outer product on them with the np.
#outer() function and dividing by the number of observations:
